# ASI - Advanced Statistical Inference
This repository was created to store all the labs code for the ASI course at EURECOM.

## Labs
This course focuses on the principles of learning from data and quantification of uncertainty, by complementing and enriching the Introduction to Statistical Learning course. 
The presentation of the material follows a common thread based on the probabilistic data modeling approach, so that many classical algorithms, such as least squares and k-means, can be seen as special cases of inference problems for more general probabilistic models. Taking a probabilistic view also allows the course to derive inference algorithms for a class of nonparametric models that have close connections with neural networks and support vector machines. 
This advanced course is complemented by these lab sessions to guide students through the design and validation of the methods developed during the lectures.

### Run the code
To run the code, we suggest you create a python environment using Conda
```shell
> conda create --name asi
```
Once the installation has completed, you can activate the new environment with 
```shell
> conda activate asi
```
Finally open the notebook with your favorite editor, like VS Code.
